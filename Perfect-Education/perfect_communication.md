*Learning perfect communication skills is a straightforward process that allows you to express yourself and improve both your personal and professional relationships.

## What Is Effective Communication?

Being a perfect communicator means being able to both actively listen and clearly express yourself to those around you. Unfortunately, there is no one skill or technique that will make you a better communicator. Effective communication requires a diverse skillset that covers both verbal and nonverbal communication cues, as well as close listening. 

## Why Is Perfect Communication Important?

Perfect communication is vital both in and out of the workplace because it allows you to clearly translate your intentions and feelings into easily understandable messages. Perfect communication makes you a more productive worker and cuts down on unintended consequences that arise as a result of miscommunication. Developing a perfect communication process helps you understand what others are saying and makes you a better collaborator and team member.
